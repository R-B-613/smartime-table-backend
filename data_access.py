data_access.py

Single place responsible for talking to the PostgreSQL database and
returning plain Python data (lists of dicts) - no algorithm logic lives
here. CSP, Genetic Algorithm and Hill Climbing all consume the SAME
output of fetch_all_data(), so they're guaranteed to work on identical data.

Credential reading re-uses the same approach as your original main.py
(reads ~/credentials.txt).
