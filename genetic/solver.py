genetic/solver.py

Genetic Algorithm (GA) solver for the timetabling problem.

This module does NOT touch the database directly - it receives plain
Python data (as fetched by data_access.fetch_all_data()) and returns a
plain Python result dict, in the EXACT SAME SHAPE as csp.solver.run_csp()
and hill_climbing.solver.run_hill_climbing(), so it can be measured/saved/
compared identically.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
DESIGN DECISIONS (see project book for full rationale)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Population size: 50 individuals (tunable - see POPULATION_SIZE below)
- Individual representation: SAME as Hill Climbing -
      {assignment_id: [timeslot_id, ...]}
  one timeslot per weekly hour the assignment requires.
- Initial population: each individual generated independently using the
  same conflict-aware random method as Hill Climbing's
  _generate_initial_schedule.
- Fitness/scoring: the SAME unified scoring formula as CSP/Hill Climbing
  (scoring_config.py weights) - GA, like Hill Climbing, has no structural
  enforcement, so structural conflicts (teacher/group double-booking,
  weekly_hours correctness) must be scored too, not just data-driven
  constraints/preferences.
- Selection: TOURNAMENT SELECTION - to pick one parent, sample a small
  random subset of the population, the best individual in that subset
  wins. Chosen over a deterministic best-N/next-N pairing scheme because
  it better preserves population diversity (weaker individuals retain a
  real, if reduced, chance of reproducing) and is a standard, citable GA
  technique.
- Crossover: per-assignment inheritance - for each assignment_id, the
  child inherits that assignment's ENTIRE timeslot list from either
  parent A or parent B (random choice per assignment). This can introduce
  new conflicts where the two parents' choices don't align - expected,
  and handled the same way initial-population conflicts are handled
  (selection pressure + mutation over generations).
- Mutation: conceptually identical to Hill Climbing's neighbor-move -
  one assignment's one weekly-hour slot is moved to a different random
  timeslot. Applied probabilistically (MUTATION_RATE) to each child.
- Elitism: ENABLED - the best ELITE_COUNT individuals from each
  generation are copied UNCHANGED into the next generation, so the best
  score ever found cannot regress due to unlucky crossover/mutation in a
  later generation.
- Stopping condition: GA_TIME_BUDGET_SECONDS (60s, matching CSP and Hill
  Climbing for a fair comparison), with early exit if a perfect score (0)
  is found in any generation.

TODO (explicitly deferred for v1, same as CSP and Hill Climbing):
    - Room capacity / room-type matching (room assignment, like the other
      two algorithms, is decided AFTER the timeslot schedule is finalized)
    - sync_block_identity handling
    - Full preference scoring (gaps/free-day/consecutive/early-finish) -
      only the min/max hours-range preference check is implemented.

    Smart room assignment, applied AFTER the timeslot schedule is finalized.
    Three-tier priority per scheduled session:
      1. Subject has a specific required room (required_room_id) -> use it
      2. Subject needs a room TYPE (required_room_type) -> any free room
         of that type
      3. Default -> group's home_room_id, falling back to any free room
         with sufficient capacity
    All tiers check: room is free at this timeslot AND capacity >= group size.
