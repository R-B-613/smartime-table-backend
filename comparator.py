"""
comparator.py

Takes the results of all 3 scheduling algorithms (CSP, Hill Climbing,
Genetic Algorithm), saves EVERY one of them to the database as its own
schedule_runs + schedule rows, then marks the single best-scoring run as
is_selected = true.

Kept as a separate module (rather than inlined in main.py) so it can be
reused identically from main.py (the command-line script) AND, later,
from a FastAPI endpoint - both callers just need to call
save_and_select_best_result(results), with no duplicated logic.

    Parameters
    ----------
    results : list of result dicts, each shaped like:
        {
            "algorithm": "CSP" | "HILL_CLIMBING" | "GENETIC",
            "status": ...,
            "score": float or None,
            "schedule_entries": [ {...}, ... ],
        }
        (the exact return shape of run_csp / run_hill_climbing / run_genetic)

    Behavior
    --------
    - Every result with a non-None score gets saved to the database via
      save_schedule_run() - so ALL algorithm runs are visible afterward
      in schedule_runs/schedule, not just the winner.
    - Results with score=None (e.g. status="NO_DATA") are skipped - there
      is nothing meaningful to save.
    - The result with the LOWEST score among the saved ones is marked
      is_selected = true via mark_run_as_selected().

    Returns
    -------
    A dict describing what happened:
        {
            "saved_run_ids": {algorithm_name: run_id, ...},
            "best_algorithm": str or None,
