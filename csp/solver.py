csp/solver.py

CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem) solver for the timetabling problem,
built with Google OR-Tools CP-SAT.

This module does NOT touch the database directly - it receives plain
Python data (as fetched by data_access.fetch_all_data()) and returns a
plain Python result dict. Saving to the DB happens elsewhere (main.py).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW HARD VS SOFT CONSTRAINTS ARE HANDLED HERE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two different mechanisms are used on purpose:

1) STRUCTURAL hard constraints (the solver is physically not allowed to
   break these - not even scored, just forbidden):
     - A teacher cannot teach two different things at the same timeslot.
     - A student group cannot attend two different lessons at the same
       timeslot.
     - A room cannot host two different lessons at the same timeslot.
     - Every curriculum_requirement must receive exactly its required
       weekly_hours.
   These come "for free" from the timetable structure - any teacher/
   school timetable would consider these absolute rules, not preferences.

2) SCORED hard/soft constraints (from teacher_constraints, weighted very
   high if type='hard', low if type='soft') and teacher_preferences
   (weighted using scoring_config.PREFERENCE_WEIGHTS). These are NOT
   structurally forbidden in the CP-SAT model (CP-SAT could technically
   still produce a solution that violates a "hard" row in
   teacher_constraints, if doing so allows the model to be feasible at
   all) - instead they're folded into one unified penalty score, using
   the EXACT SAME formula that the Genetic Algorithm and Hill Climbing
   solvers will use later, so all three algorithms can be compared fairly
   on the same scale.

This keeps CSP fast and reliable (thanks to true structural constraints)
while still producing a score that's apples-to-apples comparable with
GA/Hill Climbing.

TODO (explicitly skipped for v1, per project decision):
    - Room capacity matching (room.capacity vs student_group.student_count)
    - Room type matching (subjects.required_room_id)
    - sync_block_identity (lessons that must be scheduled simultaneously)
