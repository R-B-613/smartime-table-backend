"""
scoring_config.py

Central place for every weight/penalty constant used to score a generated
schedule. ALL THREE algorithms (CSP, Genetic Algorithm, Hill Climbing) import
from this file, so that the final scores they produce are comparable on the
same scale.

Design idea (as discussed):
- Hard constraints get a very large penalty if violated, so the algorithms
  always prefer to satisfy them first.
- Soft constraints (from teacher_constraints with type='soft') use their
  own per-row `weight` column (1-10) from the DB.
- teacher_preferences has no weight column in the DB on purpose - the
  weights for each kind of preference are defined here in code instead,
  so they can be tuned without touching the database.
