hybrid_common.py

Shared helpers for the HYBRID pipeline (CSP feasible seed -> HC/GA soft-constraint
optimisation). This file is ENTIRELY NEW and ADDITIVE: it imports and reuses the
existing solvers without modifying any of them. The existing per-algorithm
pipeline (main.py, jobs.py, the UI) is completely unaffected.

The one genuinely new piece of logic here is `csp_entries_to_schedule_map`,
which turns CSP's returned `schedule_entries` (a list of
{timeslot_id, tea_assignment_id, room_id}) into the
`{assignment_id: [timeslot_id, ...]}` dict that Hill Climbing and the Genetic
Algorithm use internally as a candidate schedule. We reconstruct it from CSP's
public output rather than modifying run_csp to expose its internal map, so CSP
stays byte-for-byte untouched.

    Rebuild the {assignment_id: [timeslot_id, ...]} representation from CSP's
    `schedule_entries` output.

    Every teacher_assignment starts with an empty list (so an assignment that
    somehow got no slot still appears, exactly as the solvers expect), then we
    append each entry's timeslot to its assignment.

    Parameters
    ----------
    schedule_entries : list of {"timeslot_id", "tea_assignment_id", "room_id"}
        The `schedule_entries` field from run_csp()'s result.
