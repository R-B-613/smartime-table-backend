"""
api/jobs.py

Runs the full scheduling pipeline (the same sequence main.py runs) as a
BACKGROUND job, and tracks its status in memory so the frontend can poll.

WHY A BACKGROUND JOB AT ALL
---------------------------
Each algorithm runs for up to its 60-second budget, so a full run is up
to ~3 minutes. You cannot hold an HTTP request open that long. So the
trigger endpoint starts the work in a thread and returns a job_id
immediately; the frontend polls GET /generation/{job_id} until status
becomes "completed" or "failed".

--- DELIBERATE LIMITATIONS OF THIS MINIMAL DESIGN ---------------------
* The job registry is an IN-MEMORY dict. That means:
    - Run uvicorn with a SINGLE worker (the default). With >1 worker,
      each process has its own registry and polling would hit the wrong
      one. (`uvicorn api.app:app` is single-worker; do NOT add --workers N.)
    - Job status is lost on server restart. The actual results are NOT
      lost - they're already saved to schedule_runs/schedule by the
      comparator - only the in-memory "is it done yet" record is.
* Only ONE generation may run at a time. A second trigger while one is
  running is rejected (409). This is intentional: running two pipelines
  in the same process at once would interleave their schedule_runs writes
  AND further contaminate the process-wide peak-memory measurement that
  performance.py already warns about. One-at-a-time keeps the academic
  comparison numbers meaningful.

The pipeline orchestration below duplicates ~15 lines from main.py rather
than importing main.main(). That's the same self-containment trade-off
used across the solvers, and it lets this return structured metrics
(which main.py only prints) without changing the working script.
